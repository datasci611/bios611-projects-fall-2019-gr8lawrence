## Investigating Insurance Coverage Status and Changes from The UMD Data

### Background and Aims:
Homelessness and lacks of health insurance coverage are closely interwoven. Among the bundle of data we received from the UMD, there are two files that contain the insurance status of clients at their entry to and exit from the shelter. However, at first inspections, many of the clients do not have any identified insurance coverage. Therefore, combined with the demographic data also available from the bundle, we wish to investigate the following questions:


### Data Used
Three separate data files were utilized in this project: the demographic data file (CLIENT_191102.tsv), the insurance status at entry (HEALTH_INS_ENTRY_191102.tsv), and the insurance status at exit (HEALTH_INS_EXIT_191102.tsv)
