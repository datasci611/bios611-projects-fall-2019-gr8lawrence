## Investigating Insurance Coverage Status and Changes from The UMD Data
### First Draft
***
### Background and Questions:
Among the bundle of data we received from the UMD, there are two files that contain the insurance status of clients at their entry to and exit from the shelter. However, at first inspections, many of the clients do not have any identified insurance coverage. Therefore, combined with the demographic data also available from the bundle, we wish to investigate the following questions:

* What proportion of the clients have insurance coverage?
* What kind of demographic attributes is associated with higher chance of coverage?
* What kind of coverage (i.e., Medicare, Medicaid, etc.) people entering the shelter typically have (for those who already have coverage)? 
* Did more people get covered at their exit from the shelter compared to at their entry to?

### Data Used
Three separate data files were utilized in this project: the demographic data file (CLIENT_191102.tsv), the insurance status at entry (HEALTH_INS_ENTRY_191102.tsv), and the insurance status at exit (HEALTH_INS_EXIT_191102.tsv)
