Hi Tianyi, I totally understand your limited timeframe.
Your readme has already communicated your project scope clearly
to me. I really admire your project organization and structure.
You have already marked all missing sections necessary and I 
am sure you will do an excellent job afterwards. 

For current stage, you have found an interesting perspective to
do a deep analysis on the insurance coverage which is awesome.
You have defined your plot types to illustrate your research. 
My advice would be generating a correlation plot to compare between
two multi-value variables. I wouldnot say for sure since I am not using 
the health insurance data, but I guess there are plenty of missing
values on entry/exit clients which will trouble your data wrangling. 
You could also consider adding date data as a dimension to 
analyze on this problem, either from time-series perspective or 
duration of time. 

Looking forward to your final project! Cheers,
