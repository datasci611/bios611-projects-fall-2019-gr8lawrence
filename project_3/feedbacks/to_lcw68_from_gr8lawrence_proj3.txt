Very solid project! I love the questions you proposed because they look practically
helpful. The data wrangling was done efficiently using Pandas and RMarkdown was well.
The data visualization is done expertly (I like your choice of using a mixture of
graphics to demonstrate distribution and correlation).The Makefile and Dockerfile
are correctly utilized. Here are some suggestions I made based on my overview of the
project:

(1) You did a great job trying to explain the variables in your analysis. However, what can be
more efficiently done for result communication is giving better titles/labels for your plots
because they are the centers of your exposition. For example, in the first plot, you might choose
"Duration of Stay" instead of "Average Time Difference" because you are already plotting
out every client's staying time. In the second plot, you might want to add "days" as
units of your "Time Length" on the x-axis.

(2) For some data (such as the duration of stay for each clients), in addition to
their distribution, you might want to provide some summary table as well (for mean,
quantiles, etc.). To make the table in R Markdown, just put all summary statistics into a data frame,
and use knitr::kable().

(3) Even though using a variety of plots can enrich the visual experience of your reader, I
strongly suggest using similar plots for exploring certain aspects of the data. For example,
you might want to stick with scatterplots when plotting the correlations, instead of using
a histogram for "correlation between age and income".

(4) You can add the correlation coefficients to the plots instead of outputting them in the
raw format, which can be kind of obscure for people who have never seen R outputs before.
You can add them as footnotes or annotations.

(5) You might want to explain each plot using two or three sentences so their meanings are clearer
to the readers.
