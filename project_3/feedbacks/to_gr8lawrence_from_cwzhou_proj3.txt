Hi Tianyi,

Good job on your project so far. You have a good overall idea going.

A few comments:
1. Is the project organized modularly, with Make as the workflow manager?
Not yet - but you wrote that it will be!

2. Does the project use both Python (Pandas specifically) and R (Tidyverse specifically) scripts?
Yes - there is good wrangling in Python and some analysis in R. You're on a good track with a clear idea in mind for the final project.

3. Is Docker used to define execution environments appropriately?
Not yet - but all we really need is the pre-existing containers for Python and R (at minimum).

4. Are the plots appropriate for the data types, the hypotheses being tested, and the points being communicated?
The plots are good and helpful for understanding how the data looks. Visualization suggestions include making the x-axis more formal rather than the variable name as well as adding titles. The different colors are very appealing visually. Do you plan on keeping all the categories for variables such as ethnicity, race, and gender where some categories have extremely low values? The comparison plots between baseline insurance entry coverage are also very helpful. Adding titles and changing the x-axis would also be good. You wrote some comments on what you will do for the final project and those tables/plots will be useful to see!

5. How can the project be organized or documented more clearly?
Definitely more interpretation of the plots would be helpful - just a few sentences after each one. You have many to be continued comments - doing and elaborating each one will make the project more helpful to UMD (so you are on the right track for the final project). Be sure to include a conclusion section to concluder your overall findings, not just if more people are getting insured when they leave the shelter. *Typo in the last header if your report : it should be "leave the shelter" not "left tbe shelter"


6. Is the purpose of the project communicated clearly?
Yes the purpose is very clear.

7. Does the purpose of the project make sense from the client’s point of view? How could the project better serve the client?
Yes, I believe the purpose is very useful for the client. 

8. Is the source of the data made clear? (Remember that this project can be part of your public portfolios, so people not familiar with UMD may see it).
Yes the source is clear but definitely needs to be expanded w/in the report (you wrote a comment about full data description later, which is good.) Make sure to mention UMD in the report!! There's no mention of it in the Data section. Likewise, in the README you should also explain what UMD is somewhere (similar to projects 1 and 2).

9. Is the interpretation of figures clearly explained?
No, there needs to be more interpretation, as I mentioned in a previous answer.

10. Is the purpose and interpretation of analysis steps clearly communicated?
Not yet, but I'm sure it will be when the analysis is done!

11. Are overall take-home messages clearly communicated?
Not yet, but the project is on the right track, so after including conclusions it will be clear!

Good job overall!!
