# Project 2: A Shiny App for Checking Data Quality

## Background
The Urban Ministries of Durham (UMD) keeps track of its service to the members of the shelter through a spreadsheet file. However, the quality of the data is somehow inconsistent throughout the bookkeeping. Practically impossible values and large amount of missing data can be found at some place of the data. Hence, I build this small application to allow the member of the UMD staff check the quality of the data.

## Goals
The app will allow the following operations:

* Inspecting the range of the dates 
* Inspecting the range, quantiles, and number of extreme values in numeric data
